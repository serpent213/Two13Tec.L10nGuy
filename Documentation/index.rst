L10nGuy |version| Documentation
===============================

L10nGuy is a Flow CLI companion that keeps Neos translation catalogs in sync
with the actual usage inside Fusion, PHP and YAML sources. It detects missing
or stale translations, reports placeholder drift, and can automatically write
or remove XLF entries.

This documentation covers the architecture and extension points for developers
who need to understand, maintain, or extend L10nGuy.
